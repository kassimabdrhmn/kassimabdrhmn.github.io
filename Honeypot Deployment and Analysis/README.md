Project: Honeypot Testing Using VMs

Objective:
To set up and test various honeypots using virtual machines to analyze potential attack methods and gather telemetry on attacker behavior.

Skills Learned:

Understanding the deployment and configuration of honeypots.

Gaining insight into attacker methodologies and network reconnaissance techniques.

Using virtualization tools for cybersecurity experimentation.

Tools Used:

Virtual machines for hosting honeypots.

Honeypot scripts and tools (acquired via GitHub).

Steps:

Deployed multiple virtual machines running different honeypots.

Configured honeypots to simulate different services (e.g., SSH, HTTP).

Analyzed traffic logs to study attacker behavior and gather intelligence.
