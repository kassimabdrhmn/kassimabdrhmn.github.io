Phishing Campaign Simulation

Objective

The Phishing Campaign Simulation project focused on creating a phishing email, deploying a malicious payload, and tracking the success of the campaign. This hands-on experience was designed to test user awareness, demonstrate social engineering tactics, and practice payload creation in a controlled setting.

Skills Learned

Understanding of social engineering techniques and their effectiveness.

Proficiency in using tools like GoPhish and SET for phishing and payload deployment.

Experience in creating and managing a phishing campaign lifecycle.

Awareness of how human vulnerabilities are exploited in cybersecurity.

Tools Used

GoPhish for email phishing simulation.

Social-Engineer Toolkit (SET) for crafting phishing payloads.

Metasploit for payload deployment and exploitation.
