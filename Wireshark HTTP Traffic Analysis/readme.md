# Wireshark HTTP Traffic Analysis Project

## Objective
The objective of this project is to analyze HTTP traffic using Wireshark, identify potential security issues such as unencrypted credentials, suspicious URLs, and unauthorized access attempts, and understand how to mitigate these threats in a network environment.

## Skills Learned
- Analyzing and interpreting HTTP traffic with Wireshark
- Identifying security vulnerabilities such as unencrypted data
- Using packet analysis to detect suspicious activities and unauthorized access attempts
- Reporting findings and proposing solutions for network security issues

## Tools Used
- **Wireshark**: A network protocol analyzer used to capture and dissect packets
- **Web Browsers and HTTP-based Services**: Used to generate traffic for analysis
- **Network Interface Cards (NIC)**: For capturing network traffic

## Steps
### 1. Capture
- Install and set up Wireshark.
- Perform various activities such as web browsing, logging into websites, and accessing HTTP-based services to generate traffic.
- Start capturing packets using Wireshark, focusing on HTTP traffic.

### 2. Analyze
- Select HTTP packets in Wireshark and analyze their details, including headers, methods, and payloads.
- Look for unencrypted login credentials, suspicious URLs, unexpected headers, or other anomalies.
- Pay close attention to communication patterns that could signal unauthorized access or malicious activity.

### 3. Report
- Export captured packets from Wireshark for further analysis and reporting.
- Document findings, including any potential security threats or vulnerabilities discovered during the analysis.
- Propose actions to mitigate the identified risks (e.g., using encryption for credentials, blocking suspicious URLs).
- Highlight how your findings could improve network security and discuss steps for remediation in a professional environment.

### Important Note
Before engaging in network traffic analysis, ensure you are authorized to intercept network traffic. Unauthorized interception may violate privacy and security laws, so always comply with relevant regulations.
