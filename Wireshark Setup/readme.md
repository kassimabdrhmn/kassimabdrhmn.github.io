# Wireshark Network Traffic Monitoring Setup

## Objective
The goal of this project was to set up Wireshark to monitor network traffic, capture packets, and analyze data to troubleshoot network issues and identify potential vulnerabilities.

## Skills Learned
- Network traffic analysis and troubleshooting
- Packet capturing and filtering techniques
- Understanding of networking protocols like TCP, UDP, and ICMP

## Tools Used
- **Wireshark**: For packet capturing and analysis
- **Network Interface Cards (NIC)**: For traffic monitoring
- Various **networking protocols** (TCP, UDP, ICMP) to analyze captured traffic

## Steps
1. **Install Wireshark**: Download and install Wireshark on your system.
2. **Configure Network Interface**: Select the network interface to capture traffic from (e.g., Ethernet or Wi-Fi).
3. **Set Filters**: Apply filters (such as HTTP, DNS, etc.) to focus on specific traffic types.
4. **Capture and Analyze**: Begin packet capture and analyze the captured packets for issues, anomalies, or network performance.
