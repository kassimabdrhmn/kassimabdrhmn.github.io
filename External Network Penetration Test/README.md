External Network Penetration Test

Objective

The External Network Penetration Test aimed to simulate an attack on an externally accessible network by scanning for open ports, identifying vulnerable services, and exploiting them. The goal was to mimic the behavior of an external threat actor and assess network vulnerabilities.

Skills Learned

Proficiency in reconnaissance techniques and open port scanning.

Ability to identify and exploit network vulnerabilities.

Experience in post-exploitation tactics and gaining persistence.

Tools Used

Nmap for network reconnaissance and port scanning.

Nessus for vulnerability scanning.

Metasploit for exploiting vulnerabilities.

Burp Suite for web service testing and analysis.

Steps

Step 1: Scan the network for open ports using Nmap.
