Project: Home Network in Cisco Packet Tracer

Objective:
The goal of this project was to design and implement a functional home network using Cisco Packet Tracer. The focus was on simulating the setup of different network devices to better understand home networking components, including routing, switching, and wireless connectivity.

Skills Learned:

Understanding of basic network architecture and design principles.

Configuration of routers, switches, and wireless access points.

Subnetting and IP address management for efficient network operations.

Troubleshooting and verifying network connectivity between devices.

Tools Used:

Cisco Packet Tracer for network simulation.

Steps:

Designed a network diagram that included a router, switch, and multiple end devices.

Configured each device with an appropriate IP address.

Implemented static routing to allow communication between different network segments.

Set up a wireless network for wireless devices and verified connectivity across all devices.
