##Project: Wireshark Setup

##Objective
The goal of this project was to set up Wireshark for network traffic analysis, enabling the monitoring and capture of network packets to identify vulnerabilities and troubleshoot network issues.

##Skills Learned:

Network traffic analysis
Packet capturing and filtering
Troubleshooting network issues
Tools Used:

Wireshark
Network Interface Cards (NIC)
Various networking protocols (TCP, UDP, ICMP)

##Steps:

Installed Wireshark on the designated machine.
Configured Wireshark to capture traffic from the appropriate network interface.
Applied filters to focus on specific traffic types (e.g., HTTP, DNS).
Analyzed captured packets to identify potential issues or unusual behavior.
