Red Team vs. Blue Team Capture the Flag (CTF) Simulation

Objective

The Red Team vs. Blue Team Capture the Flag (CTF) project involved building an environment where both offensive (Red Team) and defensive (Blue Team) techniques could be practiced. This simulation provided insights into both attacking systems and defending against cyber threats.

Skills Learned

Offensive security skills, including attack planning and execution.

Defensive strategies for detecting and mitigating attacks.

Experience with SIEM tools for monitoring and log analysis.

Report writing to document findings and mitigation strategies.

Tools Used

Kali Linux for offensive attack tools and techniques.

SIEM tools (such as Splunk) for log collection and analysis.

Splunk for visualization of attack patterns and defense metrics.

Steps

Step 1: Simulate attacks as the Red Team using Kali Linux.
