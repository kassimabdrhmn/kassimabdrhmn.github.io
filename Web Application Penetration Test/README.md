Web Application Penetration Test

Objective

The Web Application Penetration Testing project involved setting up a vulnerable web application, such as DVWA or Juice Shop, and exploiting it to practice attacks like SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and session hijacking. The aim was to gain a better understanding of common web vulnerabilities.

Skills Learned

In-depth knowledge of OWASP Top 10 web application vulnerabilities.

Proficiency in using tools like Burp Suite and OWASP ZAP for web testing.

Experience in exploiting SQL injection, XSS, and session hijacking attacks.

Understanding of data exfiltration methods through web vulnerabilities.

Tools Used

Burp Suite for intercepting and modifying web traffic.

OWASP ZAP for automated vulnerability scanning.

SQLMap for SQL injection testing.

Wfuzz for discovering hidden web resources.
