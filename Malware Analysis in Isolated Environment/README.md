Project: Malware Dissection in a Virtual Machine

Objective:
To perform malware analysis in a controlled virtual environment to understand its behavior and identify indicators of compromise (IOCs).

Skills Learned:

Setting up a virtual machine for secure malware analysis.

Dissecting and analyzing malware to identify its operational logic.

Extracting IOCs to enhance detection capabilities in security systems.

Tools Used:

Virtual machine for isolating the malware.

Analysis tools such as IDA Pro, Ghidra, and Wireshark.

Steps:

Set up an isolated virtual machine with relevant analysis tools.

Executed malware samples in the VM to observe behavior.

Captured network traffic and analyzed system changes to understand the impact.
